# Wip Notice!
This is not fully compatible for auto install and sync.
I'm working on it on my spare time, why I create a better/simplified way to install and sync the configuration files with the linux home. 
I could use gnu/stow, but I'm exploring my own implementation. You might still be able to clone and run `stow home`.

# My Dotfiles
This repository contains my recent dotfiles setting thing up for Arch Linux, 
but it also serves as a way to revisit what I've done for [my old dive into i3wm](https://github.com/brunodles/i3wm-conf).
_(Which dates from ~2014)_

This repo will also be used to setup the same tools (when possible), for multiple computers running Ubuntu, MacOs and Mint.

## Tools and Configurations
This repo will use some known tools like.
* alacritty - terminal emulator
* tmux - multiplexer
* zsh - custom prompt
* oh my zsh - framework for zsh, plugins, themes and more
* feh - image preview and linux background
* compton - xComposition, allows transparency
* thunar - file browser

## Code
This repo will receive some reimplementations for script that I did for [my old dive into i3wm](https://github.com/brunodles/i3wm-conf).

## Instalation
A install script will be provided to simplify the instaltion process.
_(and to keep my sanity maintaing this running in multiple machines)_

ToDo: Some of tools only apply in specific environments. 
Future scripts should take care of it. 

TBD

### Fonts
This repo also install custom fonts to be used for/with:
* Status bar
* Terminal / ZSH
* Tmux

The patched fonts downloaded from:
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [PowerLine](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
* [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

Might merge into a single font.
